# Hey!
Currently being worked on, will add whatever I feel is an upgrade.

Not 100% sure what all to add, but if you go to the GitHub you can request recipes!

# Features
- Any logs to sticks and chests
- Hay bales to Bread
- Enchanted Golden Apple, but you have to use a regular golden apple to make it.
- Wool to String
- String to Cobweb
- Clay block to Clay

# Future ideas
- Suggest ideas in the GitHub
